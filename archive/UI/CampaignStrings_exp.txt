// The "CampaignList" key defines the campaigns which will
// appear on the campaign selection screen.  The values listed
// here are the section names of the specific campaign mission data
// below.  The order of these values is significant, as that is the
// order in which they will appear on the campaign selection screen.

CampaignList="","","","","TPoF"

// The sections below make up the campaign data for each specific
// campaign.  Each mission entry is made up of 3 comma-separated
// strings.  In order they are: Header, Mission Name, Map Filename.
// You can have up to 128 missions in a given campaign, but putting
// more than 15 will make a scrollbar appear to see the rest.
//
// Each campaign section can also have three cinematics associated
// with them: Intro Cinematic, Open Cinematic, and End Cintematic.
// The cinematic entries follow a similar pattern as the mission
// entries: Header, Cinematic Name, Cinematic Filename.
//
// Using the "DefaultOpen" key, you can specify that this campaign
// should be initially open and selectable by a new user.
//
// You can specify which model to use for the background, using the
// "Background" key.  The value specified must be an entry in the
// war3skins.txt file. Realize that this value is processed using the
// expansion naming convention (i.e. V0, V1, etc).  You should also set
// the fog parameters using the "BackgroundFogXXX" keys.
//
// The racial cursor for the campaign can be set using the "Cursor"
// key.  The values are as follows: Human = 0, Orc = 1, Undead = 2,
// Night Elf = 3.
//
// Finally, you can set which ambient sound to play on this screen using
// the "AmbientSound" key.  The value specified must be an entry in
// the AmbienceSounds.slk file.
